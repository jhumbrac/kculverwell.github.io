	<p id="description">Our mission is to build a community of crafters, who are looking for a special place to do what we do best. Don&#39;t we all need a place to get away for a bit to spark our creative spirit? Make | Craft | Forever is here to help you do just that! Step away from the dishwasher and come hang with us for a few hours to start something new and exciting and that will probably sparkle.

	We hope you will join us! Please feel free to contact us if you are interested in any of our workshops.</p>
